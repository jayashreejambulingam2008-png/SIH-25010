## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
A smart, AI-powered agricultural advisory system delivered through a mobile application or chatbot with support for regional languages and voice commands.
How It Addresses the Problem

Provides data-driven, real-time advice tailored to the farmer’s location, soil type, and crop.

Reduces reliance on informal or misleading sources of information.

Makes expert agricultural advice accessible to all farmers, regardless of literacy or connectivity levels.

Innovation and Uniqueness

Combines AI and local language support to deliver personalized and context-aware guidance.

Uses image-based pest detection powered by computer vision.

Offers voice-first interaction to break the digital literacy barrier.

Integrates market price tracking, weather data, and soil recommendations in one platform

## Technical Approach
Technologies to Be Used

Mobile App / Chatbot Framework: Flutter / React Native / WhatsApp Business API

AI & ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest detection, crop recommendation, yield prediction

NLP & Speech: Google Speech-to-Text / Microsoft Azure TTS for voice support

Backend: Node.js / Django

Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase

APIs & Data Sources:

IMD for weather data

ICAR/State Soil Data

Agmarknet for mandi prices

Methodology & Implementation Process

User Onboarding – Via mobile number, select language and voice/text preference.

Soil & Crop Profiling – Input from farmers and/or integration with soil health databases.

Real-Time Advisory – Based on user location, weather, and crop stage.

Image Upload Module – Farmers upload images of diseased crops; AI diagnoses issue.

Market Insights – Fetch daily mandi prices and suggest selling strategies.

Feedback Loop – Farmers can rate advice, enabling algorithm improvement.

(Flowchart or prototype visuals can be attached separately if needed.)

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility Analysis

Technically viable using existing mobile and AI technologies.

Financially sustainable through public-private partnerships or freemium models.

Scalable due to modular design and cloud infrastructure.

Challenges and Risks

Low smartphone penetration in remote areas
Solution: Include USSD/IVR support or partner with digital kiosks.

Data accuracy for soil and local conditions
Solution: Collaborate with government and research institutions for verified data sources.

Resistance to new tech
Solution: Partner with local NGOs for training and awareness campaigns.

## Impact and Benefits
Social Impact

Increases agricultural knowledge and self-reliance among farmers.

Reduces dependence on exploitative middlemen or unverified sources.

Economic Benefits

Higher yields and reduced input costs.

Better market access and pricing decisions.

Environmental Benefits

Promotes sustainable practices, reducing overuse of fertilizers and pesticides.

Supports climate-resilient agriculture through weather-aware planning.
